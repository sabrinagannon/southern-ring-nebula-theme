# Southern Ring Nebula Theme

**Note I have not tested all the different apps that this theme was generated with, it's very possible there are some bugs**

Directory structure has vim at the top level for ease of installation with vim/neovim, but more themes are under [extras](extras/).

I didn't include the actual image that I pulled the palette from because image files are big, but you can [view and download them here](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/033/01G709QXZPFH83NZFAFP66WVCZ?news=true).

Some of the colors were manipulated from the original image to increase their contrast enough to meet [WCAG accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## Why did I chose the southern ring nebula image to make a theme?

I've had a terrible, beautiful past two years on Earth, and while all of the images from the telescope so far captured that beauty, the image of a star undergoing a multi-millennia long death captured the duality of how I feel about the last two years (and counting). Someday all that dust from that star is going to end up being a part of something else entirely, and maybe it will even be seen by another telescope. I like to think so at least.

### Credits

- [Kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) for inspiring me to make a theme based again, and the directory structure.

- [NASA and STScl](https://webbtelescope.org/copyright) for the [images from the James Webb Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/webbfirstimages).
  - I also want to acknowledge [the controversy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-revelations-raise-pressure-on-nasa-to-rename-the-james-webb-space-telescope/) of the telescope name, and share that I would love to see it renamed.

- [Themer](https://github.com/themerdev/themer) for the generating the first version of this theme based off of the colour palette I picked from the image.

- [WebAIM's contrast tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), which I used to check the contrast on all of the main colours used with this theme.
